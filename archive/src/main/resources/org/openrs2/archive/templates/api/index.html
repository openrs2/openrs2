			<h2><code>GET /caches/&lt;scope&gt;/&lt;id&gt;/disk.zip</code></h2>

			<p>
				Returns a cache as a ZIP archive of <code>.dat/.idx</code>
				(old engine) or <code>.dat2/.idx</code> (new engine) files. All
				files are stored underneath a <code>cache</code> subdirectory
				in the zip archive.
			</p>

			<h2><code>GET /caches/&lt;scope&gt;/&lt;id&gt;/flat-file.tar.gz</code></h2>

			<p>
				Returns a cache as a gzipped tarball of files, where each
				file in the tarball holds a single file from the cache (old
				engine) or single group (new engine).
			</p>

			<p>
				The paths within the archive all have a format of
				<code>cache/&lt;index&gt;/&lt;file&gt;.dat</code> (old engine)
				or <code>cache/&lt;archive&gt;/&lt;group&gt;.dat</code> (new
				engine).
			</p>

			<p>The two byte version trailers are included.</p>

			<h2><code>GET /caches/&lt;scope&gt;/&lt;id&gt;/keys.json</code></h2>

			<p>Returns a list of valid XTEA keys for the cache in JSON format:</p>

			<pre><code>[
    {
        // The ID of the archive containing the group the key is used for.
        // Typically this is 5 (maps), but do note that RuneScape 3 does

        // name or if the name is not known.
        "name": "l40_55",

        // The ID of the map square, if the group is an encrypted loc group
        // (has a name of lX_Z). The map square ID is ((X &lt;&lt; 8) | Z).

            -1419269290
        ]
    },
    ...
]</code></pre>

			<h2><code>GET /caches/&lt;scope&gt;/&lt;id&gt;/keys.zip</code></h2>

			<p>
				Returns a zip archive file of valid XTEA keys for loc groups.
				Each key is stored in a text file containing four lines, with
				each line containing a 32-bit component of the key as a decimal
				string. The paths within the archive all have a format of
				<code>keys/&lt;mapsquare&gt;.txt</code>.
			</p>

			<h2><code>GET /caches/&lt;scope&gt;/&lt;id&gt;/map.png</code></h2>

			<p>
				Renders the map squares in the cache, with a coloured outline
				representing whether we have a valid key for each map square or
				not:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li><strong>Valid key:</strong> green outline.</li>
				<li><strong>Loc group is not encrypted:</strong> green outline.</li>
				<li><strong>Empty loc group:</strong> grey outline.</li>
				<li><strong>Key unknown:</strong> red outline.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				Empty loc groups may be replaced with an unencrypted equivalent
				with a cache editor.
			</p>

			<h2><code>GET /caches/&lt;scope&gt;/&lt;id&gt;/archives/&lt;archive&gt;/groups/&lt;group&gt;.dat</code></h2>

			<p>
				Returns a single file (old engine) or group (new engine) in
				binary format. The response contains a <code>.jag</code>
				archive (index 0 of an old engine cache), a GZIP-compressed
				file (the remaining indexes of an old engine cache) or
				JS5-compressed data (new engine cache, also known as a
				container). The two byte version trailer is not included.
			</p>

			<h2><code>GET /caches/&lt;scope&gt;/archives/&lt;archive&gt;/groups/&lt;group&gt;/versions/&lt;version&gt;/checksums/&lt;checksum&gt;.dat</code></h2>

			<p>
				Returns a single file (old engine) or group (new engine) in
				binary format. The response contains a <code>.jag</code>
				archive (index 0 of an old engine cache), a GZIP-compressed
				file (the remaining indexes of an old engine cache) or
				JS5-compressed data (new engine cache, also known as a
				container). The two byte version trailer is not included.
			</p>

			<p>
				This is faster than the previous endpoint as it doesn't need to
				look the group's version and checksum up in the JS5 index. If
				you need to download more than a handful of groups, you should
				use this endpoint.
			</p>

			<h2><code>GET /keys/all.json</code></h2>

			<p>
				Returns a list of all XTEA keys in the database, including
				candidate keys that have not been validated against any cache.
			</p>

			<pre><code>[
    // The XTEA key, represented as four 32-bit integers.
    [
        -2147135705,
        1113423446,
        1294100345,
        946019601
    ],
    ...
]</code></pre>

			<h2><code>GET /keys/valid.json</code></h2>

			<p>
				Returns a list of XTEA keys in the database, only including
				keys validated against at least one cache.
			</p>

			<pre><code>[
    // The XTEA key, represented as four 32-bit integers.
    [
