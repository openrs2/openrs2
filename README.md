# OpenRS2

[![GitHub Actions][actions-badge]][actions] [![Discord][discord-badge]][discord] [![ISC license][isc-badge]][isc]

## Introduction

OpenRS2 is an open-source multiplayer game server and suite of associated tools.
It is compatible with build 550 of the RuneScape client, which was released in
late 2009.

## Prerequisites

OpenRS2 requires version 11 or later of the [Java Development Kit][jdk].

The JDK is required even if a pre-built copy of OpenRS2 is used, as it depends
on JDK-only tools, such as `jarsigner`, at runtime.

### Non-free components

OpenRS2 requires the original RuneScape client code, data and location file
encryption keys, which we cannot legally distribute.

These files must be manually placed in the `nonfree` directory (directly beneath
the root of the repository), in the following structure:

```
nonfree
├── lib
│   ├── jaggl.pack200
│   ├── loader_gl.jar
│   ├── loader.jar
│   ├── runescape_gl.pack200
│   ├── runescape.jar
│   └── unpackclass.pack
└── share
    ├── cache
    │   ├── 0
    │   │   ├── 0.dat
    │   │   └── ...
    │   ├── ...
    │   └── 255
    │       ├── ...
    │       └── 28.dat
    └── keys.json
```

The CRC-32 checksums and SHA-256 digests of the correct files are:

| CRC-32 checksum | SHA-256 digest                                                     | File                   |
|----------------:|--------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|

|   `-2129469231` | `31182683ba04dc0ad45859161c13f66424b10deb0b2df10aa58b48bba57402db` | `loader_gl.jar`        |
|   `-1516355035` | `ccdfaa86be07452ddd69f869ade86ea900dbb916fd853db16602edf2eb54211b` | `loader.jar`           |
|    `-132784534` | `4a5032ea8079d2154617ae1f21dfcc46a10e023c8ba23a4827d5e25e75c73045` | `runescape_gl.pack200` |
|    `1692522675` | `0ab28a95e7c5993860ff439ebb331c0df02ad40aa1f544777ed91b46d30d3d24` | `runescape.jar`        |
|   `-1911426584` | `7c090e07f8d754d09804ff6e9733ef3ba227893b6b639436db90977b39122590` | `unpackclass.pack`     |

The `.gitignore` file includes the `nonfree` directory to prevent any non-free
material from being accidentally included in the repository.

## Building
